## Prompt Engineering Patterns

### Character-Driven Narrative
- Focus on defining detailed characters with appearance, emotions, personality.
- Describe their actions, interactions, and temporal dynamics.
- Set environment and cinematic framing to support narrative immersion.
- Use medium-length prompts (50-120 words) for balanced storytelling.

### Precision Technical
- Emphasize detailed physical properties, material interactions, environmental context.
- Include camera specifications, lighting conditions, color grading.
- Use long prompts (120-300+ words) for precise control and cinematic production.
- Treat Sora as a world simulator describing miniature worlds with internal consistency.

### Viral Community
- Leverage strong style keywords and clear concepts.
- Use short prompts (<50 words) for creative exploration and viral appeal.
- Examples often focus on visually striking or conceptually unique scenes.

## Audio Elements

Sora 2 introduces synchronized audio generation alongside video. While specific audio prompt examples are not detailed in the provided content, the inclusion of synchronized audio is a key feature expanding text-to-video capabilities.

## Prompt Examples

### Five Pillars Template Example: Tokyo Walk Prompt (Official OpenAI)
```
Subject: A stylish woman in black leather jacket, long red dress, black boots,
         sunglasses, red lipstick
Action: Walks confidently and casually down the street
Environment: Tokyo street at night, warm glowing neon, animated signage,
             damp reflective ground, many pedestrians
Cinematic: Implied medium shot following character
Aesthetic: Photorealistic with emphasis on lighting and reflections

Full Prompt:
"A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and
animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and
black boots, and carries a black purse. She wears sunglasses and red lipstick.
She walks confidently and casually. The street is damp and reflective, creating
a mirror effect of the colorful lights. Many pedestrians walk about."
```

### World Simulator Paradigm Example: Dragon over Glacier (Sora 2 Official)
```
Primary Target & Visuals:
A dragon slicing past serrated ice spires jutting from a glacier, trailing
embers that flare in its wake like fireflies, wings spread wide casting
shadows on the sunlit ice below, arcing low over a deep fjord...

Format & Appearance:
4K resolution, large-format digital sensor emulation, aspherical 50mm lens,
fine grain simulation

Camera & Filter:
Nose-mounted gimbal-stabilized aerial platform, tracking shot POV,
1/8 Black Pro-Mist filter for gentle halation on highlights

Grading & Palette:
Neutral to cool-temperature color palette (glacial blues, slate grays,
pale mist whites), warm accents only on embers and reflected sunlight

Lighting & Atmosphere:
Indirect natural light from late-afternoon sun angled low,
subtle god-rays breaking through mist layers...

## Prompt Length Strategy

| Length       | Best For                              | Example Use Case                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| SHORT (<50)  | Clear concepts with strong style    | Creative exploration                   |
| MEDIUM (50–120) | Balanced creative prompts with narrative depth | Character-driven scenes               |
| LONG (120–300+) | Precision control & technical specs | Cinematic productions                  |

## Cinematic Techniques and Visual Styling

### Shot Scales and Framing

- Extreme Wide Shot (EWS): Sense of scale; example - astronaut on Martian plain.
- Close-Up (CU): Emotional intimacy; example - elderly woman reading letter.
- Extreme Close-Up (ECU): Heightened detail; example - pianist's fingers on keys.

### Camera Angles and Perspectives

- Low Angle Shot: Makes subject appear powerful; example - basketball player dunking.
- POV Shot: First-person immersion; example - race car driver helmet view.
- Dutch Angle / Tilted Frame: Creates unease; example - person walking dark alley.

### Camera Movements

- Drone / Aerial Shot: Sweeping vistas; example - river through autumn forest.
- Steadicam / Gimbal: Fluid tracking; example - restaurant kitchen flow.
- Handheld: Documentary feel; example - journalist running protest.

### Lighting Techniques

- Golden Hour: Romantic mood; example - couple walking beach at sunset.
- Low-Key Lighting: Dramatic noir mood; example - detective's office lamp light.
- Volumetric Lighting / God Rays: Ethereal atmosphere; example - cathedral interior.
