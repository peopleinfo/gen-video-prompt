- Frameworks and Methodologies for Sora 2 Prompts:

  1. The Five Pillars Framework:
     - Subject & Character: Define WHO or WHAT (appearance, clothing, emotions, personality)
     - Action & Motion: Describe WHAT IS HAPPENING (verbs, movements, interactions, temporal dynamics)
     - Environment & Setting: Establish WHERE and WHEN (location, time of day, weather, atmosphere)
     - Cinematic Framing: Define HOW IT'S SEEN (camera angles, movements, shot types, lens specs)
     - Aesthetic & Style: Determine LOOK and FEEL (photorealistic vs animated, film stock, color grading, lighting mood)

     Example (Tokyo Walk Prompt):
     ```
     Subject: A stylish woman in black leather jacket, long red dress, black boots,
              sunglasses, red lipstick
     Action: Walks confidently and casually down the street
     Environment: Tokyo street at night, warm glowing neon, animated signage,
                  damp reflective ground, many pedestrians
     Cinematic: Implied medium shot following character
     Aesthetic: Photorealistic with emphasis on lighting and reflections

     Full Prompt:
     "A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and
      animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress,
      and black boots, and carries a black purse. She wears sunglasses and red lipstick.
      She walks confidently and casually. The street is damp and reflective,
      creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights. Many pedestrians walk about."
     ```

  2. The World Simulator Paradigm:
     - Treat Sora as a physics-based world simulator requiring prompts that describe complete miniature worlds with internal consistency.
     
     Good prompt example:
     ```
     "A coffee cup sits on a wooden table. Steam rises from the hot liquid,
      creating swirling patterns that catch the morning sunlight streaming
      through a nearby window. The liquid ripples gently."
     ```
     
     Advanced example (Dragon over Glacier):
     ```
     Primary Target & Visuals:
       A dragon slicing past serrated ice spires jutting from a glacier,
       trailing embers that flare in its wake like fireflies,
       wings spread wide casting shadows on sunlit ice below,
       arcing low over a deep fjord with steep walls looming.

     Format & Appearance:
       4K resolution, large-format digital sensor emulation,
       aspherical 50mm lens, fine grain simulation

     Camera & Filter:
       Nose-mounted gimbal-stabilized aerial platform,
       tracking shot POV,
       1/8 Black Pro-Mist filter for gentle halation on highlights

     Grading & Palette:
       Neutral to cool-temperature color palette (glacial blues,
       slate grays, pale mist whites), warm accents only on embers
       and reflected sunlight

     Lighting & Atmosphere:
       Indirect natural light from late-afternoon sun angled low,
       subtle god-rays breaking through mist layers,
       soft atmospheric perspective fading distant peaks
     ```

  3. Prompt Length Strategy:
     - SHORT (<50 words): Clear concepts with strong style keywords; use for creative exploration.
       Example: "A gorgeously rendered papercraft world of a coral reef rife with colorful fish and sea creatures."
       
     - MEDIUM (50-120 words): Balanced creative prompts with narrative depth; standard storytelling.
       
     - LONG (120-300+ words): Precision control and technical specifications; cinematic productions.
       Example: Dragon over Glacier prompt above.

- Cinematic Techniques and Visual Styling:

  1. Shot Scales and Framing:

    - Extreme Wide Shot (EWS):
      Effect: Sense of scale, loneliness, epic scope
      Example:
      ```
      Extreme wide shot of a lone astronaut standing on a red Martian plain,
      with massive rock formations towering in the distance and two moons visible
      in the pink-hued sky. The astronaut appears tiny against the epic landscape.
      ```

    - Close-Up (CU):
      Effect: Maximum emotional intimacy
      Example:
      ```
      Close-up of an elderly woman's face as she reads a letter,
      tears forming in her eyes. Every wrinkle visible,
      lit by soft window light from the side.
      ```

    - Extreme Close-Up (ECU):
      Effect: Hyper-focus detail builds suspense
      Example:
      ```
      Extreme close-up of pianist's fingers dancing across piano keys,
      showing precise moment each finger strikes.
      ```

  2. Camera Angles and Perspectives:

    - Low Angle Shot:
      Effect: Subject appears powerful or heroic
      Example:
      ```
      Low angle shot of basketball player about to dunk,
      camera at floor level looking up.
      ```

    - POV Shot:
      Effect: First-person immersion
      Example:
      ```
      POV shot inside race car driver's helmet showing steering wheel,
      gloved hands gripping tightly.
      ```

    - Dutch Angle / Tilted Frame:
      Effect: Unease or tension
      Example:
      ```
      Dutch angle shot of person walking through dark alley at night,
      camera tilted 15 degrees creating diagonal compositions.
      ```

  3. Camera Movements:

    - Drone / Aerial Shot:
      Effect: Sweeping vistas and dynamic motion
      Example:
      ```
      Drone shot swooping over winding river through autumn forest;
      camera starts high then descends closer to water surface.
      ```

    - Steadicam / Gimbal:
      Effect: Fluid professional tracking
      Example:
      ```
      Steadicam shot gliding through busy restaurant kitchen;
      smooth continuous take flowing between chefs and prep stations.
      ```

    - Handheld:
        Effect: Documentary feel with urgency and realism
        Example:
        ```
        Handheld camera following journalist running through crowded protest;
        frame bounces slightly capturing raw energy.
        ```

  4. Lighting Techniques:

    - Golden Hour Lighting:
        Mood: Romantic, nostalgic
        Example Prompt:
        ```
        Golden hour cinematography of couple walking on beach;
        low sun creates long shadows with warm orange-pink tones;
        soft flattering light wraps around subjects.
        ```

    - Low-Key Lighting:
        Mood: Dramatic film noir style
        Example Prompt:
        ```
        Low-key noir lighting in detective's office;
        single desk lamp creates pool of light surrounded by darkness;
        high contrast shadows create mysterious atmosphere.
        ```

    - Volumetric Lighting / God Rays:
        Mood: Ethereal spiritual atmosphere
        Example Prompt:
        ```
        Interior old cathedral with volumetric lighting;
        dust particles visible in shafts of sunlight through stained glass;
        divine ethereal atmosphere created by light beams.
        ```
