## **🧭 What Is a “Strong Prompt”?**

A **strong prompt** is one that gives Sora just the right amount of *specific, visually grounded detail* — enough for the model to clearly understand what to generate — **without overloading it** with contradictions, vagueness, or too many actions.

Think of it like giving direction to a cinematographer who can perfectly visualize what you describe, but can’t ask questions later.  
 You’re describing one shot — not a whole film — and your words are the only “storyboard.”

---

## **🎞️ Strong Prompt vs. Weak Prompt (Example)**

| Weak Prompt | Strong Prompt |
| ----- | ----- |
| “A beautiful street at night.” | “Wet asphalt, zebra crosswalk, neon signs reflecting in puddles.” |
| “A person moves quickly.” | “A cyclist pedals three times, brakes, and stops at the crosswalk.” |
| “Cinematic look.” | “Anamorphic 2.0x lens, shallow DOF, volumetric light from streetlamps.” |

The *strong* prompt gives the model **visual cues it can actually render** — texture, motion, light, and timing.  
 Words like “beautiful,” “cool,” or “cinematic” don’t mean much to the model unless you define *what that looks like.*

## **🧩 Key Traits of a Strong Sora Prompt**

### **1\. Specific and Visual**

* Use *concrete nouns and verbs*: “raindrops hit glass” instead of “rainy mood.”

* Describe visible results, not emotions alone.  
   ✅ *“A single candle flickers beside a photo frame.”*  
   ❌ *“A sad scene.”*

### **2\. One Clear Action \+ One Camera Move**

* Keep motion simple and readable.  
   ✅ “The actor walks three steps to the window, pauses, then looks out.”  
   ❌ “The actor runs, turns, waves, and dances across the room.”

### **3\. Defined Lighting and Color Anchors**

* Describe light quality \+ direction \+ color palette.  
   ✅ “Soft window light with warm lamp fill, cool rim from hallway; palette: amber, cream, walnut brown.”

### **4\. Stable Style & Lens**

* Tell Sora what *kind* of image it should emulate:  
   ✅ “Shot on 35 mm film, handheld, subtle film grain.”  
   ✅ “Digital 4K look, high contrast, cool tone palette.”

### **5\. Temporal Beats**

* Break time into beats so the model knows pacing.  
   ✅ “He opens the book — one beat — turns a page — one beat — smiles softly.”

### **6\. Dialogue Clearly Separated**

If there’s speech, format it cleanly:

Dialogue:

\- Detective: "You’re lying. I can hear it in your silence."

\- Suspect: "Or maybe I’m just tired of talking."

### **7\. Intentional Brevity**

A strong prompt doesn’t have to be long — it just has to be *clear and layered*.  
 Leave room for creative interpretation where it won’t break continuity.

## **🧠 Shortcut Formula for Strong Prompts**

**\[Setting \+ Time\]**, **\[Style\]**, **\[Subject \+ Action\]**,  
 **\[Lighting \+ Palette\]**, **\[Camera Setup\]**,  
 (Optional) **\[Dialogue / Sound cues\]**

### **Example:**

“Golden hour in a quiet suburban street. Shot on 16 mm film with handheld movement and soft lens flares. A paperboy rides past in slow motion, tossing a newspaper onto a porch. Warm sunlight glows through the trees; palette: gold, sage, denim blue. Camera tracks alongside at eye level. Sound: faint bicycle chain and distant dog bark.”

That’s a **strong prompt** — concrete, cinematic, emotionally clear, yet leaves room for variation.
