Format & Look
Duration 4s; 180° shutter; digital capture emulating 65 mm photochemical contrast; fine grain; subtle halation on speculars; no gate weave.

Lenses & Filtration
32 mm / 50 mm spherical primes; Black Pro-Mist 1/4; slight CPL rotation to manage glass reflections on train windows.

Grade / Palette
Highlights: clean morning sunlight with amber lift.
Mids: balanced neutrals with slight teal cast in shadows.
Blacks: soft, neutral with mild lift for haze retention.

Natural sunlight from camera left, low angle (07:30 AM).
Bounce: 4×4 ultrabounce silver from trackside.
Negative fill from opposite wall.
Practical: sodium platform lights on dim fade.
Atmos: gentle mist; train exhaust drift through light beam.

Location & Framing
Urban commuter platform, dawn.
Foreground: yellow safety line, coffee cup on bench.
Midground: waiting passengers silhouetted in haze.
Background: arriving train braking to a stop.
Avoid signage or corporate branding.

Wardrobe / Props / Extras

Footsteps and paper rustle; no score or added foley.

Optimized Shot List (2 shots / 4 s total)

0.00–2.40 — “Arrival Drift” (32 mm, shoulder-mounted slow dolly left)
Camera slides past platform signage edge; shallow focus reveals traveler mid-frame looking down tracks. Morning light blooms across lens; train headlights flare softly through mist. Purpose: establish setting and tone, hint anticipation.

2.40–4.00 — “Turn and Pause” (50 mm, slow arc in)
Cut to tighter over-shoulder arc as train halts; traveler turns slightly toward camera, catching sunlight rim across cheek and phone screen reflection. Eyes flick up toward something unseen. Purpose: create human focal moment with minimal motion.

Camera Notes (Why It Reads)
Keep eyeline low and close to lens axis for intimacy.
Allow micro flares from train glass as aesthetic texture.
Preserve subtle handheld imperfection for realism.
Do not break silhouette clarity with overexposed flare; retain skin highlight roll-off.

Finishing
Fine-grain overlay with mild chroma noise for realism; restrained halation on practicals; warm-cool LUT for morning split tone.
Mix: prioritize train and ambient detail over footstep transients.
Poster frame: traveler mid-turn, golden rim light, arriving train soft-focus in background haze.
